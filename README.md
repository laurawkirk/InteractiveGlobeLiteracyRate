# Using a combination of html,css, and d3 I have created an interactive globe that stores data on literacy rate by country. I have implemented a function so that you are able to rotate the globe in any direction you may chose. Zooming in is also a function on this globe. When you hover over a specific country that country's outline will be a highlighted and a pop up will appear. The pop up displays literacy rate as a percent as well as the year that the rate was collected. A horizontal bar chart is also included in the pop up, showing the literacy rate for every country in the world in decreasing order. The country you have selected bars will be highlighted in blue, so you can see how that country's literacy rate compares to those of other countries. The data I used was published by UNESCO in 2018.
